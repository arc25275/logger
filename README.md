# Logger

Logger is a WIP discord bot to log all actions and events that can happen in a discord server!

This is my first bot, and I know this isn't an original idea, but I still want practice.

## Planned Features:

- Adding all events
- Making what channel it logs to configurable via a command
- Making what events get logged configurable via a command
- Hopefully making code less shitty

## Current Features
