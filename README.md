# Logger
Logger is a WIP discord bot to log all actions and events that can happen in a discord server! 

This is my first bot, and I know this isn't an original idea, but I still want practice.

Planned Features:
* Adding all events
* Making what channel it logs to configurable via a command
* Making what events get logged configurable via a command
* Hopefully making code less shitty
